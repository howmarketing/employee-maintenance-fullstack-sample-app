## AI RESPONSE

> Implementing the repository pattern for CRUD operations is an excellent idea, especially as your application grows in complexity. It offers several benefits:
>

1. Separation of concerns: It isolates data access logic from business logic.
2. Improved testability: Easier to mock data access for unit testing.
3. Flexibility: Allows for easier switching between different data sources or ORMs.
4. Consistency: Provides a standard interface for data operations across the application.

Here's how you might refactor your code to incorporate the repository pattern:

```typescript:src/app/api/employee/route.ts
import { EmployeeRepository } from '@/repositories/employeeRepository';
import { CreateEmployeeDTO } from '@/dtos/employeeDTO';
// ... other imports ...

const employeeRepository = new EmployeeRepository(prisma);

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body: CreateEmployeeDTO = await request.json();

    const createSchema = z.object({
      // ... schema definition ...
    });

    const validatedData = createSchema.parse(body);

    const createdEmployee = await employeeRepository.createEmployee(validatedData);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      success: true,
      message: "Success",
      data: createdEmployee
    }), {
      status: 201,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      },
      statusText: "CREATED",
    });
  } catch (e: any) {
    // ... error handling ...
  }
}
```

Then, create a new file for the repository:

```typescript:src/repositories/employeeRepository.ts
import { PrismaClient, Employee, Department } from "@prisma/client";
import { CreateEmployeeDTO } from '@/dtos/employeeDTO';

export class EmployeeRepository {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaClient) {}

  async createEmployee(data: CreateEmployeeDTO): Promise<Employee & { department: Department | null }> {
    const createdEmployee = await this.prisma.employee.create({
      data,
      include: {
        department: true,
        EmployeeDepartmentHistory: true
      }
    });

    if (data.departmentKey) {
      await this.prisma.employeeDepartmentHistory.create({
        data: {
          employeeId: createdEmployee.id,
          departmentKey: data.departmentKey,
          departmentLabel: createdEmployee.department?.label || "",
        }
      });
    }

    return createdEmployee;
  }

  // Add other CRUD methods here...
}
```

This approach:
1. Moves data access logic to a dedicated repository class.
2. Keeps the route handler focused on HTTP concerns and basic flow control.
3. Makes it easier to reuse data access logic across different parts of your application.
4. Improves testability by allowing you to mock the repository in your route handler tests.

Remember to create appropriate DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to define the shape of data being passed around, which can help with type safety and documentation.

## AI RESPONSE

> Certainly! I'll provide you with the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the shape of data being passed around in your application. These DTOs will help improve type safety and documentation. Based on the code snippets you've provided, here are the key DTOs we can define:
>

```typescript
// EmployeeDTO.ts

import { Department, Employee, EmployeeDepartmentHistory } from "@prisma/client";

export interface EmployeeDTO extends Employee {
    department: Department | null;
    EmployeeDepartmentHistory: EmployeeDepartmentHistory[];
}

export interface CreateEmployeeDTO {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    hireDate: string | null;
    isActive: boolean;
    departmentKey: string;
    phone: string;
    address: string;
}

export interface UpdateEmployeeDTO {
    publicId: string;
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    hireDate?: string;
    isActive?: boolean;
    departmentKey?: string;
    phone?: string;
    address?: string;
}

export interface UpdateEmployeeActiveStatusDTO {
    publicId: string;
    isActive: boolean;
}

export interface UpdateEmployeeDepartmentDTO {
    publicId: string;
    departmentKey: string;
}

// DepartmentDTO.ts

import { Department } from "@prisma/client";

export interface DepartmentDTO extends Department {}

export interface CreateDepartmentDTO {
    key: string;
    label: string;
}

// ResponseDTO.ts

export interface BaseResponseDTO<T> {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    data: T;
}

export interface EmployeeResponseDTO extends BaseResponseDTO<EmployeeDTO> {}

export interface EmployeesListResponseDTO extends BaseResponseDTO<EmployeeDTO[]> {}

export interface DepartmentResponseDTO extends BaseResponseDTO<DepartmentDTO> {}

export interface DepartmentsListResponseDTO extends BaseResponseDTO<DepartmentDTO[]> {}
```

These DTOs cover the main data structures used in your application for employees and departments. They provide clear interfaces for creating, updating, and retrieving data, as well as standardized response formats.

To use these DTOs, you would replace the existing interfaces and types in your code. For example:


```8:18:src/app/api/employee/route.ts
export interface CreateEmployeeDAO extends Employee {
	department: Department | null
}

export type CreateEmployeeRequestDAO = Omit<Omit<Omit<Omit<Omit<CreateEmployeeDAO, 'department'>, 'updatedAt'>, 'createdAt'>, 'publicId'>, 'id'>;

export interface CreateEmployeeResponse {
	success: boolean;
	message: string;
	data: CreateEmployeeDAO;
}
```


These lines could be replaced with imports from the new DTO files:

```typescript
import { CreateEmployeeDTO, EmployeeResponseDTO } from '@/dtos/EmployeeDTO';
import { BaseResponseDTO } from '@/dtos/ResponseDTO';
```

Similarly, in other files where you define types for requests and responses, you can import and use these DTOs to ensure consistency across your application.
